# sql-challenge

Provided in this Repository is a collection of SQL Queries pertaining to six csv files provided. As part of the exercise, we created tables for each csv, mapping Primary-Foreign Key relationships based on the id's included in each table. 

Attached is an ERD of the schema (ERD_screenshot), as well as the SQL Query (sql_table_creation.sql) creating the associated tables. In order to import the csv's into the created tables, I used PSQL COPY function to copy the file path of the csv and import the data into the relevant columns of the created table. 

In the data_analysis_sql_challenge.sql file, I go through each requested report and provide comments to separate out different questions. Below the comment is the associated SQL query to generate the desired information. Each query is tested and confirmed to work as intended.

Thanks!
